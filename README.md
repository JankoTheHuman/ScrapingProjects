# ScrapingProjects
I did multiple web scraping projects but these are 2 I am most proud of. 

Email scrape scrapes emails from your inbox, meaning people that responded to a specific email. 
You can use SEARCH variable and put the subject of the email you want to be shown and get all the people that responded to that email campaign. We used that in a sales campaign to see who responded to it.

Second websrcape is from NPLA website that holds companies and their info in blocks of content. 
My job was to manually find contacts from those 200ish companies but I created this script to pull the info and then input it into Seamless.ai to get lead info.

Third is job vacancies from Indeed website for marketing campaign to see which companies are in a need for sales services.

Fourth is a template, the basic point for most of my web scraping needs, a skeleton that every project needs.
